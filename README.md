# Analysis-of-Sectoral-P-E-and-Implementation-of-Trading-Strategies-Using-Machine-Learning
In the ever-evolving realm of financial markets, I find it imperative to delve into the analysis of sector-specific valuation metrics to make well-informed investment decisions. This project centers around the exploration of Price-to-Earnings (PE) dynamics, focusing particularly on the Health and Industrial sectors.I aim to unravel insights into sectoral valuation trends and construct a trading strategy grounded in machine learning principles.
### Data description:
In the dataset provided for this analysis, we will be focusing on Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratios, a critical valuation metric calculated by dividing the market price per share by the earnings per share. The PE ratio serves as a key indicator in assessing the relative value of a stock, playing a crucial role in investment decision-making. Additionally, the dataset includes information on returns, indicating the percentage change in value from the previous day.

The data, sourced from the "hw3_data.csv" file available in the repository, specifically explores PE ratios and returns for both the Industrial and Financial Sectors. Throughout the following questions, we will delve into the intricacies of this dataset to gain insights and derive meaningful conclusions about the valuation dynamics and performance trends within these sectors.

 **Health_PE**: Refers to the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio for the Health sector. 

**HealthSector_Returns**: Represents the returns (percentage change) of the Health sector. 

**Industrial_PE**: Similar to "Health_PE," this column represents the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio for the Industrial sector.

**IndustrialSector_Returns**: Similar to "HealthSector_Returns," this column represents the returns (percentage change) of the Industrial sector.
