### Mini Project 3
# Project Title: Optimizing Sectoral PE Analysis and Algorithmic Trading Strategies

## Overview:

This project focuses on the optimization of algorithmic trading strategies through an in-depth analysis of sectoral Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratios. By implementing advanced machine learning techniques and thorough hyperparameter tuning, the goal is to maximize portfolio performance and provide valuable insights into sector-specific trading decisions.

## Project Structure:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - Analyze historical PE ratios and returns for Health and Industrial sectors.
   - Understand dataset characteristics, trends, and potential challenges.
   - Preprocess data to ensure accuracy and suitability for algorithmic trading strategies.

2. **Algorithmic Trading Strategy Development:**
   - Implement a dynamic trading strategy based on Fisher transformed PE values.
   - Design entry and exit signals using upper and lower thresholds.
   - Leverage Python for strategy development and testing.

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - Conduct an extensive hyperparameter analysis with at least 400 combinations.
   - Utilize geometric mean returns as a performance metric.
   - Identify optimal hyperparameters for both Health and Industrial sectors.

4. **Portfolio Construction:**
   - Formulate an equally weighted portfolio based on the combined returns from Health and Industrial sector strategies.
   - Calculate cumulative returns and assess the overall performance of the portfolio.

5. **Visualizations:**
   - Generate visualizations, including cumulative returns for individual sectors and the equally weighted portfolio.
   - Enhance insights into trends, growth patterns, and potential areas for improvement.

### Data description: hw3_data.csv
In the dataset provided for this analysis, we will be focusing on Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratios, a critical valuation metric calculated by dividing the market price per share by the earnings per share. The PE ratio serves as a key indicator in assessing the relative value of a stock, playing a crucial role in investment decision-making. Additionally, the dataset includes information on returns, indicating the percentage change in value from the previous day.

The data, sourced from the "hw3_data.csv" file available in the repository, specifically explores PE ratios and returns for both the Industrial and Financial Sectors. Throughout the following questions, we will delve into the intricacies of this dataset to gain insights and derive meaningful conclusions about the valuation dynamics and performance trends within these sectors.

 **Health_PE**: Refers to the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio for the Health sector. 

**HealthSector_Returns**: Represents the returns (percentage change) of the Health sector. 

**Industrial_PE**: Similar to "Health_PE," this column represents the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio for the Industrial sector.

**IndustrialSector_Returns**: Similar to "HealthSector_Returns," this column represents the returns (percentage change) of the Industrial sector.

## Project Conclusion:

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of algorithmic trading strategies, hyperparameter tuning, and portfolio construction based on sectoral PE analysis. The results and insights aim to guide further optimizations and improvements in algorithmic trading decisions.
